Download ConvertLichMapToGenie.html and lichmap.js into the same folder on your local machine, and open ConvertLichMapToGenie.html in your web browser.

You can replace lichmap with the latest lichmap db, just add the following text to the beginning:
```var mapdata = ```

...so that it looks like:
```
var mapdata = [{
  "id": 0,
  "title": [
    "[[Muspar'i, Tuul Yamshuk Staho]]"
  ],
```
